        <p>Hello there! This is my very first website. I built it entirely out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and wrote it all using Visual Studio Code. This is not only my first website ever published, but my first one after I have graduated from the technical bootcamp called Bloom Institue of Technology. I graduated as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
