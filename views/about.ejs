            <p>Hello there! This is my very first website. I built it with EJS using HTML syntax, CSS, and JavaScript! This is not only my first website created from scratch, but my first one after I have graduated from the technology school named Bloom Institue of Technology. I started the Full Stack Web Development program on August 10th, 2023 and graduated on February 10th, 2025.</p>
