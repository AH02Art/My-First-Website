# My-First-Website
Building my first website

This Project is my very first website that I will build from stratch. I haven't decided to use pure HTML and JavaScript or React for working with the browser. 
I am doing this to remain eligible for the Tuition Refund Guarantee from BloomTech by pushing my project's progress onto GitHub. 
Of course I must keep doing this for a whole year or until I get a job offer from a job that pays at least $50K.
